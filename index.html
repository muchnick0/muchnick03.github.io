<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<body>
<p><b>This website is dedicated to my patron saint, Blessed Jordan of Saxony.</b></p>
<p>This website will serve as a written miscellany of ideas and thoughts, ranging from theology to logic to programming. It will mostly pertain to the study of classical logic, as advocated for by the peripatetics and schoolmen. The logic of the second operation of the intellect, of the Stoics and modern logicians, will also be discussed, but less so.</p>
<h4>A prayer:</h4> <br>
<p>O Lord, through Your divine intellect and eternal goodness, I petition You to grant me the virtues of understanding and discernment, of love for all knowledge which traces back to You. 
<br><br>
Most Holy Spirit, descend upon me like the gentle dewfall; illuminate my intellect to further understand You and to worship You more perfectly. Amen.</p>
