<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<body>
<p><b>This website is dedicated to my patron saint, Blessed Jordan of Saxony.</b></p>
<p>This website will serve as a written miscellany of ideas and thoughts, ranging from theology to logic to programming. It will mostly pertain to the study of classical logic, as advocated for by the peripatetics and schoolmen. The logic of the second operation of the intellect, of the Stoics and modern logicians, will also be discussed, but less so.</p>
<h4>A prayer:</h4> <br>
Aid me, Lord, in my inquiry, to as much knowledge as our reason
can attain as I examine those things which you have deigned to
reveal to us, and that we hold by most firm faith. For you have
preached that you are first and last; teach your servant therefore
to show by reason that you are sole, true, total being, and first
efficient cause of all things and their ultimate end, and above all
of those things for which you bear your chief care, namely the intellectual 
and rational creature. You are blessed for ages of ages.
Amen.
<p>-Bl. John Duns Scotus</p>
