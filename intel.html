<h1>Corporations are Evil</h1>
<h2>And more news at six</h2>
<p>In most technology circles, it is common knowledge that technology companies, barring a couple, are unironically evil and have no regard for the consumer. Outside of these circles, however, it seems to be scarcely discussed just how little regard Intel, AMD, and other manufacturers have for you. The most perfect example which could be conceived of is the existence of the Intel Management Engine, or Intel ME, which has been in nearly every Intel processor since the 965 chipset. The Intel Management Engine is essentially an embedded computer which physically exists in the GMCH (Graphics & Memory Chip Holder) for the C2D series, and in the PCH (Platform Controller Hub) chip for the i3/i5/i7 series of processors. The ME has its own timer, processor core, cache, RAM, and internal bus to be able to access other devices such as a cryptography engine and the host machine's ram (much like a parasite). It even uses its own operating system, Minix, which they're allowed to do without making the ME open source because Minix uses the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/bsd.en.html">BSD license</a>. The Management Engine effectively makes it so that you will never have full control over your computer, as Intel forces you to run their non-free software. It also poses an obvious security risk, with Intel is easily able to access your computer from the Management Engine. AMD, the second largest processor manufacturer, is not exempt from being evil either, for they have something very similar in the form of AMD PSP. There have been quite a few efforts on moving the Intel Management Engine, such as the <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a> and <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> projects. I will not go too in depth on this subject, since it has been went over many, many times; therefore, I have little interest in being the thousandth person to say the same thing on this topic.
