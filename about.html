<h1>About the Author</h1>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<body>
<p><i>But by the grace of God, I am what I am</i></p>
I, the author, am of very little significance regarding the aims of this website. However, since the proper operation of man is to understand (cf. <i>Metaphysics, Book 1, L1, n3</i>), I shall bring forth that which fulfills man's proper operation.<br><br>
I am a 19 year old student, who lives in the United States of America. I possess many interests, but the study of logic is what primarily interests me. The logics whoch most captivate me would be the syllogistic logic, those which pertain to programming language theory (lambda calculus, type theories, System F, Hoare, &c) and scholastic logic.<br><br>I am a Latin Catholic in union with (<i>una cum</i>) Pope Francis, and I attend an FSSP Mass every Sunday. I aspire to be a Dominican priest, though I am also considering a traditional society (I am undecided in this matter). I hope to live and die for the Catholic Church, which of course means living and dying for Our Lord. I see nothing else which could possibly satisfy me in this life.<br><br>
The equipment I use to maintain this website is a measely Thinkpad X200s running Debian; I write everything in Neovim, and then push it to main using git. I occasionally use my Corebooted X230 running GNU Guix to push changes as well.<br><br>
<h2>What is the purpose of this site?</h2>
<p><i>In the workings of God nothing is without purpose</i></p>
The aim of this website is simply to relay the logic which was handed down to us by the schoolmen. The history and practice of scholastic logic has been obscured, and as such, there have not been many historians on the subject, let alone condensed summaries. Therefore, I wish to act as that middle-man. <br><br>
The website itself, however, is inspired by Richard Stallman's <a href="stallman.org">personal website</a>, <a href="http://cat-v.org">cat-v</a>, and the late Luke Smith. Of course, the focus is less on the author, as Stallman's is, instead opting for a topical approach. I also do not like the Javascript-infested dynamic websites, which takes up much of your bandwith, as most websites could operate with simple html/css (as mine is). Furthermore, there is a charm which simple websites carry, and this seems to be a phenomenon among many people, as evidenced by the existence of site-builders such as neocities.
