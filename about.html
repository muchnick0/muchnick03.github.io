<h1>About the Author</h1>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<body>
<p><i>But by the grace of God, I am what I am</i></p>
<p>
I, the author, am of very little significance regarding the aims of this website. However, since the proper operation of man is to understand (cf. <i>Metaphysics, Book 1, L1, n3</i>), I shall bring forth that which fulfills man's proper operation.<br><br>
I am a 19 year old student, who lives in the United States of America. I possess many interests, but the study of logic is what primarily interests me. The logics which most captivate me would be the syllogistic logic, those which pertain to programming language theory (lambda calculus, type theories, System F, Hoare, &c) and scholastic logic.<br><br>I am a Latin Catholic in union with (<i>una cum</i>) Pope Francis, and I attend an FSSP Mass every Sunday. I aspire to be a Dominican priest, though I am also considering a traditional society (I am undecided in this matter). I hope to live and die for the Catholic Church, which of course means living and dying for Our Lord. I see nothing else which could possibly satisfy me, or anybody for that matter, in this life.<br><br>
The equipment I use to maintain this website is a measly Thinkpad X200s running Debian; I write everything in Neovim, and then push it using git. I occasionally use my <a href="intel.html">corebooted</a> Thinkpad X230 running GNU Guix to push changes as well. I use GitHub Pages to host, which I am not too happy about, but it suffices at a price which can't be beaten.
<h3>Misc.</h3>
I enjoy learning about programming, but I haven't had a serious project in a number of years, as I fell out of it for that number. I am relearning Haskell at the moment using two books: <i><a href="https://github.com/FrenzyExists/programming-books/blob/master/Haskell/Haskell%20Programming%20from%20First%20Principles%20by%20Chris%20Allen%2C%20Julie%20Moronuki.pdf">Haskell Programming from First Principles</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth">Haskell in Depth</a></i>. I've always been interested in how things work from first principles, or their foundational axiom[s]. For instance, when I first got into programming, I wanted to learn C and Assembly, for I [wrongly] thought low-level languages were the true first principles. Though, it became clear to me that it was the logic which preceded computation. This is why I initially became interested in theology, as theology is the mother of all sciences, in so far as every other science is dependent on theology as such.

<h2>What is the purpose of this site?</h2>
<p><i>In the workings of God nothing is without purpose</i></p>
<p>
The aim of this website is simply to relay the logic which was handed down to us by the schoolmen. The history and practice of scholastic logic has been obscured, and as such, there have not been many historians on the subject, let alone condensed summaries. Therefore, I wish to act as that middle-man. However, I would like to also bridge the gaps between modern subjects, such as modern mathematics, with the logic of the schoolmen. As I currently write this on 2025-04-21, Easter Monday, I am unsure how to do so; I suppose the Cracow Circle would be the most obvious example, but I am overall unread on their general philosophy, since most of it seems to be obscured in a dastardly language (that is, Polish). If you're unaware, the goal of the Cracow Circle was to axiomatize and formalize Catholic doctrine and Thomist theology using mathematical logic (Murawski, 2021). The Neo-Thomism of the 20th century is truly a spectacle in our great history.<br><br>
The website itself is inspired by Richard Stallman's <a href="stallman.org">personal website</a>, <a href="http://cat-v.org">cat-v</a> (though, Uriel would disagree with me on most things), and the late Luke Smith. Of course, the focus is less on the author, as Stallman's is, opting for a topical approach. I also do not like the Javascript-infested dynamic websites, which takes up much of your bandwith, as most websites could operate on simple html/css (as mine does). It is quite ridiculous that my X200s can barely load a Medium article. Furthermore, there is a charm which simple websites carry, and this seems to be a phenomenon affecting many people, as evidenced by the existence of site-builders such as neocities.
